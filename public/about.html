<P>I began my education at the Air Force Technical School, <br>
    where I also served as an instructor. This role not only honed my technical skills but also instilled in me the values of discipline,<br>
 responsibility, and leadership. My time in the Air Force was a formative period, during which I developed a strong work ethic and a deep sense of commitment.</P>
